# Mobile Web Programming Assignment 1: MyMemberLink App

This applicationâ€™s source code includes a **Splash Screen**, **Login**, and **Registration Screen**, all built with **Flutter** and **Dart**. It connects to a MySQL database through a PHP backend service, hosted on XAMPP, and integrates additional features like **Google Sign-In** and **Facebook Sign-In** via Firebase. It also includes a **password reset** feature to enhance user support.

Hope you will feel well with my source code! :)
